I'm a Creative Technologist crazy about UI and UX research, Cloud Computing, Computer Graphics, AR/VR, and a bit of cybersecurity, IoT, Digital Marketing, human-centric design, and curious about new technologies.

I am also a human being who enjoys doing outdoor activities like hiking, water sports, climbing, and among other things, I like to read technical and non-technical books/blogs.
